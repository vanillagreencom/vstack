# Codex

TOML agents, a 1024-character bound on a skill's description, and no command directory: a command installs as a skill and the lock records what was written. Owner: `crates/core/src/harness/codex.rs`.

## Roots

| Scope | Path | Relocated by |
|---|---|---|
| Global | `~/.codex` | `CODEX_HOME` |
| Project | `<project>/.codex`, plus the shared `<project>/.agents` | nothing |

Project markers: a `.codex/` or `.agents/` directory.

## Surfaces

| Kind | Global | Project | Caps |
|---|---|---|---|
| agent | `~/.codex/agents/*.toml` | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | managed, both |
| skill | `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, shared with Pi, OpenCode, Gemini and Copilot; `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for a copy delivery | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, shared with Pi and Antigravity | managed, both |
| command | — | — | install, toggle, remove, refresh both; `installs_as: skill` |
| hook | `~/.codex/hooks.json` | `.codex/hooks.json` | managed, both, enforced |
| mcp-server | `~/.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.<name>]` | `.codex/config.toml` | managed, both |
| plugin | `~/.codex/plugins/` cache tree with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, toggles in `config.toml` `[plugins]` | — | observe only, global |
| pi-extension | — | — | unsupported |

Codex removed custom prompts in 0.118 (2026-03), so `~/.codex/prompts` is read by nothing and kendex neither scans nor writes it; a command is a skill there, invoked as `$name` or through `/skills`.

Codex reads three skill roots at user level: the shared `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, and `~/.codex/skills/.system`, where it stages the skills it ships. A global install lands in the shared tree, one definition every tool reading it sees. `~/.codex/skills` is read as well, and is the only one of the three that is Codex's alone, so it is where a global copy delivery writes its tree and where a skill an older install left is read back (`a_global_copy_for_codex_writes_the_directory_only_codex_reads`, `crates/core/tests/surfaces.rs`).

## Format

- Skill description at most 1024 characters; a longer one is refused for this harness alone, naming the skill (`crates/core/src/render/validate/skill.rs`). No body cap.
- Name rule `Any`; namespace separator `__`.
- MCP transports: stdio and streamable HTTP, never SSE, and an SSE declaration is refused for this harness with that reason. A server is its own `[mcp_servers.<name>]` table, written through a `toml_edit` pass that keeps the file's comments, ordering and other tables (`crates/core/src/configedit/codex_mcp.rs`): `command` and `args` for a stdio server, `url` for a streamable-HTTP one, no `type`. Codex reads an `env` value literally and passes a parent variable through by its own name under `env_vars`, so a catalog `env` table becomes that list, and a `$NAME` reference that would land under another key is refused with the name to use. Switching off writes `enabled = false` on the table and switching on takes it away, so the declaration stays until removal. A project's file loads only once Codex trusts the project, which the TUI grants an undecided local project on first launch; `codex mcp add` writes the user file alone and rewrites its whole `mcp_servers` table, so kendex does not go through it.
- Agent file: TOML, `<name>.toml`. Fields written: `name`, `nickname_candidates`, `description`, `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`, and `developer_instructions` as a triple-quoted string carrying the whole prompt (`crates/core/src/render/agent/codex.rs`).
- Model dialect: every tier resolves to `gpt-6-astra`; an omitted key is Codex's spelling of inherit (`crates/core/src/harness/models.rs`). `model_reasoning_effort` is written as given (`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`); an absent key takes the model's own default.
- Permissions: Codex has no tool allowlist. A read-only allowlist caps `sandbox_mode` at `read-only`, any other allowlist at `workspace-write`, and only an explicit Engineer role with no allowlist earns `danger-full-access`; an allowlist always warns that the list itself is not enforced.
- Tool vocabulary: prose is rewritten to phrases, `Read` to "open the file", `Bash` to "run a shell command" (`crates/core/src/render/vocab/mod.rs`).

## Hooks

Enforced for the events Codex understands, mapped by identity: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop` (`codex_event`, `crates/core/src/hook.rs`). Any other event renders as advisory prose inside the agent files.

The script lands at `<root>/hooks/<name>.sh`; the registration goes into `hooks.json` in the nested matcher-plus-handlers shape, timeout in seconds as authored, the command finding the project root when it runs at project scope ([Hook commands](README.md#hook-commands)). Installing a hook also merges `[features] hooks = true` into `config.toml` as a text-level edit that keeps comments and ordering.

Agent scoping: none. Only `agents = "all"` custom hooks are enforced; scoped ones render as advisory prose in the agent files.

## Commands stored as skills

A declared command becomes a one-file skill tree: a generated `SKILL.md` carrying the command's prose, the loader frontmatter and the generated-file banner, recorded in the lock as an emitted skill artifact (`crates/core/src/engine/desired_command.rs`, `crates/core/src/render/command.rs`). Names resolve in one pass over every declared command in name order: a real skill keeps its name, a clashing command takes `<name>__command`, then `<name>__cmd`, each with a warning naming what to type, and when all three are taken nothing is written. At project scope the tree lands in `.agents/skills`, which Pi reads too; that the command appears in Pi's skill list is emitted as a warning.
