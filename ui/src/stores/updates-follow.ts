// The Follow source switch: one row's state change, then a write that
// settles behind it. The chain a flip starts — move the hold, apply the
// scope, then read every scope's standing again — takes seconds of git and
// planning, and awaiting it before the switch moves would leave the switch
// dead under the hand that clicked it. The flip is recorded here as
// pending, worn by the rows on screen until the read that follows the
// write lands.
//
// Two different things are scoped and page-wide. What the pending record
// decides is which ROWS the landing may not be acted on from — an apply
// moves what is installed in that scope and nowhere else. The write itself
// raises the store's page-wide `busy` for as long as it, its reload and the
// rescan behind it run, because that flag is what a check refuses on, and a
// write it did not cover is a check running beside a commit its report
// predates.
