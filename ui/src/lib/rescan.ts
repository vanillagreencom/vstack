// What "everything on the machine, read again" means, in one place.
//
// Three reads stand behind every page: the scan says what is on the machine,
// the audit says what it scored, and the provenance join says where each
// installation came from. A refresh of only the first would leave every
// score on screen answering for content the same call had just re-read — so
// they go together, and none waits on another.
//
// The join is read here rather than on each reader's own guess at when to
// re-read. Such guesses are proxies for "something installed", and every
// one misses a route: an install redirected into another project writes its
// rows under the destination's key, so a page watching its own rows sees
// nothing happen. Here, every write that already says "read the machine
// again" refreshes it, including routes nobody has thought of.
//
// The rule, for every write that reaches `repo_effects`: the machine is read
// again once the write has been answered for, whatever it answered. No
// caller carves itself out, for the two reasons below.
//
// A refusal is no account of what is on disk. `repo_effects::execute` runs
// the leaving packages' uninstallers before the plan, so an `Undo` error
// comes back with what they did standing and the plan — manifest save
// included — never run; a plan that does run and then fails rolls back
// whole, `run_journaled` restoring every path it touched; and an error can
// come back over a write that committed in full. The answer does not say
// which happened.
//
// Nor is a success a complete account: `moved` covers the two states
// `moving` counts, `removed` the other destructive one, and a dropped
// rendering can answer with all three fields empty. So no predicate over
// the response decides this, and a write that moved nothing pays one read
// rather than leaving a dated page.
//
// [`writingRepo`] carries the rule: a write that reaches `repo_effects` runs
// its whole body inside it — the marketplace subscribe, install, repository
// effect, source toggle and unsubscribe, the drift-report install, the
// editor save, and the audit's item actions — so a ninth cannot skip it.
// The Updates page spells the call out instead, as the last step inside its
// own `holdingBusy`: `updates.ts`'s [`updateOne`] and [`updateRows`],
// `updates-edits.ts`'s `run` and `updates-follow.ts`'s [`followSwitch`].
// The package page's `package-version-actions.ts` `afterChange` makes the
// same call inside its busy block without awaiting it, so nothing holds
// over the read. `grep -rnE "writingRepo\(|rescanEverything\(" ui/src` is
// the whole set.
//
// The rest of the direct callers are not the writes this rule is about:
// none of them reaches `repo_effects`. The Scan again buttons ask because
// nothing else knows what a person changed outside the app;
// `settings.ts`'s [`setHarnessRoot`] and `settings-projects.ts`'s project
// register and unregister because moving a tool's folder or changing which
// projects are tracked changes which files the scan finds and which scopes
// the audit reads. Those three write the settings file and nothing else, so
// gating them on the answer is correct.
//
// A scope with no view of its own counts zero unmanaged items, which is how
// a project card ends up hiding the only way to the ones it holds — the
// reason the registry writes above rescan at all.
