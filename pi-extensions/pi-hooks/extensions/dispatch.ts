/**
 * The rendered guards the settings surface names one by one. A registration
 * running one of them is armed by its own setting; everything else the
 * registry names — a custom hook above all, which is a command of the person's
 * own with no script of ours behind it — has no toggle and rides the master
 * switch. An unrecognised name therefore runs, which is the direction a guard
 * has to fail in.
 *
 * `session-drift-check` and `task-completed-check` are here because this
 * carrier also ports them natively, on the same two listeners, behind these
 * same two settings — so one switch turns the guard off however it arrives,
 * and neither copy is silently on while the surface says otherwise. Both ports
 * stay: no catalog hook of kendex's names Pi in its own `harnesses:` line for
 * either, so nothing registers them for Pi and nothing doubles. A person who
 * registers their own copy anyway gets both, and this setting turns off both.
 *
 * A `Map`, not an object: a hook's name is its own file name, and an object
 * would answer `toString`, `constructor` and six other inherited words with a
 * function — truthy, so the lookup succeeds, `getBool` returns undefined for a
 * setting `DEFAULTS` does not hold, and a hook named any of them is skipped in
 * silence. tests/registry.test.ts renders one and holds it to refusing.

 * whose last statement happens to succeed as it is torn down — settles as
 * `timedOut: true, exitCode: 0`. Read in the other order, that was a clean
 * run: the one status this must never take from a run that was cut off. A hook
 * stopped part way judged nothing, whatever it managed to exit with.

 * nothing about which render is missing or how to put it back. Only a hook of
 * kendex's is named that way, because only that has a render to name — a
 * command-bodied hook is the person's own text, which can hold a credential
 * inline and never reaches a message. That is the test rather than the flag
 * alone: `registry.ts` sets `missing` only where a script exists, and a hook
 * carrying the flag without one goes to the spawn, whose status names its own

 *   Claude Code ever routes into a model's context (`SessionStart`). Silence

 * - Exit 2: the refusal Claude Code's own `PostToolUse`, `Stop` and
 *   `SessionStart` hooks make, and its stderr is written for the model. Pi
 *   gates none of these events, so it is delivered rather than obeyed, which
 *   `docs/adapters/pi.md` sets out per listener.
 * - Anything else: a hook that judged nothing, said plainly. Nothing here can
 *   stand aside on its behalf, so the agent is told rather than left to read a
 *   silence as an all-clear.
