# Audit Workflow

Analyze issues for proper configuration: relations, agent labels, hierarchy, project placement, duplicates, obsolete items, and combinations.

**Additional for PROJECT mode**: Project scope validation, inter-project dependencies, architecture gap analysis, project recommendations.

**Do NOT** modify the issue tracker. Return recommendations only.

## Inputs

| Arg | Mode | Input Set |
|-----|------|-----------|
| `--project <name>` | PROJECT | All issues in named project |
| `--project` (no name) | PROJECT | All issues in active project |
| `--issues <file_path>` | ISSUES | Proposed issues from JSON file |

**ISSUE mode file schema**: Provided by the orchestration skill (audit-issues-input).

File contains all context — read with Read tool. Optional fields for research-complete: `blocked_issues`, `research_ref`, `decision_ref`.

---

## 1. Initialize Mode & Fetch Context

### 1.1 Determine Mode

Parse arguments → set `MODE` (project | issues).

**PROJECT mode**: Store `WORKTREE` from delegation prompt (default: `.`).

**ISSUES mode**: Read JSON file with Read tool, extract:
- `WORKTREE` from `worktree` field
- `PARENT_ISSUE` from `parent_issue` field
- `SOURCE` from `source` field
- `INPUT_ITEMS` from `items[]` array
- `BLOCKED_ISSUES` from `blocked_issues` field (optional, research-complete only)
- `RESEARCH_ISSUE` from `research_issue` field (optional, research-complete only)
- `RESEARCH_REF` from `research_ref` field (optional, research-complete only)
- `DECISION_REF` from `decision_ref` field (optional, research-complete only)

### 1.2 Fetch All Projects

Query ALL project states:
```bash
$ISSUE_CLI cache projects list --state started
$ISSUE_CLI cache projects list --state planned
$ISSUE_CLI cache projects list --state backlog
$ISSUE_CLI cache projects list --state completed
$ISSUE_CLI cache projects list --state paused
```

Store project IDs and metadata for cross-project analysis.

### 1.3 Fetch Input Issues

**PROJECT**: Fetch all issues in target project (all states):
```bash
$ISSUE_CLI cache issues list --project "[PROJECT]" --state "Backlog,Todo,In Progress,In Review,Done" --max
```

**ISSUES**: For existing issues, fetch each:
```bash
$ISSUE_CLI cache issues get [ISSUE_ID]
```
For proposed issues, use provided fields directly.

### 1.4 Fetch Comparison Set

Fetch issues from ALL projects (from 1.2) for duplicate/obsolete/fit checking:
```bash
$ISSUE_CLI cache issues list --project "[PROJECT_NAME]" --state "Backlog,Todo,In Progress,In Review,Done" --max
```

Run for each project. Store all issues for comparison in 6.

**Why all projects**: Cross-project duplicate detection, obsolete checking against completed work, and project fit evaluation all require visibility into the full backlog.

### 1.5 Extract Project Definitions

For EACH project from 1.2, extract from name + description + content:

| Field | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | What is this project for? (implementation, testing, refactoring, validation) |
| **Work Type** | What kind of issues belong here? |
| **Scope** | What components/modules does this project own? |

**[PROJECT only]** For target project, also grep codebase for constants/APIs it modifies:
```bash
grep -rn "[CONSTANT_NAME]\|[API_NAME]" ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/
```

---

## 2. Extract Contracts

For each INPUT issue, extract from title + description:

| Field | Extract |
|-------|---------|
| **Target** | Component/file being modified |
| **Creates** | New APIs, seams, types, tests this introduces |
| **Consumes** | Existing APIs, seams, types this uses or extends |
| **Problem** | What bug/gap/feature it addresses |
| **Decisions** | Use decider skill: `$DECISIONS_CMD search "[TARGET_KEYWORDS]"` for decisions governing the target area. Flag if proposed approach contradicts an active decision |

**Build** contract table: `ID | Target | Creates | Consumes | Problem | Decision Conflict`

---

## 3. Validate Project Scope

**Skip if** MODE = issue.

### 3.1 Validate Issue Fit

For each issue, verify it matches the target project definition from 1.5.

| Mismatch | Example | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Wrong work type | "Add tests" in implementation project | Add to `wrong_project[]` |
| Wrong scope | New feature in "Tech Debt" project | Add to `wrong_project[]` |
| Name vs content | Project says "refactoring" but issue is new feature | Add to `wrong_project[]` |

### 3.2 Analyze Project Dependencies

Trace what depends on this project's modifications:

1. **List what this project modifies** (constants, APIs, patterns)

2. **Find dependents**: Which projects build on or test those modifications?

3. **Validate blocking**: If Project A modifies code that Project B uses → A should block B

Add to `project_dependency_issues[]`:
```json
{
  "from_project": "string",
  "to_project": "string",
  "current_relation": "none|blocks|blocked_by",
  "should_be": "blocks|blocked_by|none",
  "reason": "A modifies [X] which B depends on"
}
```

---

## 4. Identify Candidate Pairs

**Do not compare every pair.** Build candidate pairs from signals:

| Signal | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Same target component | Likely related |
| Same parent issue | Sibling order dependency |
| Issue mentions another issue ID | Explicit connection |
| Creates-Consumes overlap | Potential dependency |
| Existing issue tracker relation | Must verify correctness |

### 4.1 Group by Target and Parent

Group input issues by target component and by parent. Same-group issues are candidates for relation analysis.

### 4.2 Scan Cross-Target Dependencies

Scan for Creates-Consumes matches across different targets:
- Issue A (target X) creates `FooService`
- Issue B (target Y) consumes `FooService`
- → Candidate pair despite different targets

### 4.3 Include Comparison Set Matches

Compare input issues against comparison set (1.4) for:
- Same target component
- Same file path in location field — issues modifying the same file are always candidates
- Creates-Consumes overlap
- Same problem description

**File-path overlap**: When two issues share a file path, grep for shared structs/functions to detect implicit dependencies that aren't visible from title/description alone.

### 4.4 Verify Existing Relations

For input issues with existing relations, add to candidate pairs for verification.

**Done issue relations are valid historical records.** Flag removal only for wrong dependencies (no creates-consumes), never because source is Done.

### 4.5 Scan for Relation Violations

**Iterate** ALL `blocks`/`blocked_by` relations on input issues (and their children if bundled).

**Violation types**:

| Violation | Detection |
|-----------|-----------|
| Cross-project blocking | A.project != B.project |
| Cross-bundle child blocking | A.parent != B.parent (both have parents) |
| Child blocks standalone | A has parent, B has no parent (or vice versa) |

**Remediation principle**: Blocking relations are valuable — always preserve them by relocating issues to the same project. Never remove a valid blocking relation.

**Decision tree**:

1. **Cross-project blocking**:
   - If issue-level blocking aligns with project ordering (3.2) → skip (redundant specificity)
   - Otherwise → move one issue to the other's project
   - **Check** 1.5 scope definitions to determine which issue to move
   - If issue is a child, it must move with its parent (or be detached first)
   - **Add** to `wrong_project[]` with target project and reason referencing the blocking relation
   - **Do NOT create project-level dependencies from individual issue relations** — project deps come from project-order audit scope analysis, not bottom-up from 1-2 issue crossings

2. **Cross-bundle child blocking** (same project): Lift to parent level.
   - **Add** child relation to `remove_relations[]`
   - **Add** parent-level relation to `add_relations[]`
   - **Add** `related` between original children for traceability

3. **Cross-bundle child blocking** (different projects): Relocate first (step 1), then lift to parent level (step 2).

For each violation, record: `remove_relations[]` reason: `"Violation: [TYPE] — [FROM] [REL] [TO]"`

---

## 5. Analyze Candidate Pairs

For each candidate pair (A, B):

### 5.1 Check Dependencies

**Three sources of blocking relations** (check all, merge results):

1. **Creates-Consumes**: Does B consume what A creates? Standard dependency analysis.

2. **Caller hints**: If input items have `blocks_items`/`blocked_by_items`/`blocks_issues`/`blocked_by_issues` fields, validate them against contracts. Carry forward valid hints; drop contradictions.

3. **Agent-sequencing**: Apply cross-domain blocking rules to same-project sibling issues with different agent domains.

**Same-project constraint**: `blocks`/`blocked_by` relations must be within the same project. See [dependencies.md](../references/dependencies.md).

| Dependency Found | Same Project? | Recommendation |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| A creates → B consumes | Yes | `blocks` relation |
| A creates → B consumes | No | `related` only |
| Agent-sequencing candidate + data flow confirmed | Yes | `blocks` relation |
| Agent-sequencing candidate, no data flow | Either | No relation |
| No dependency | Either | `related` only if informational link useful |

**Default to `blocks` when dependency exists AND same project.**

**Blocking level rule**: Blocking relations go on bundle parents, not children. A child issue must not block an issue under a different parent. If A is bundled under parent P1 and B is under parent P2 (or standalone), then P1 blocks P2 — never A blocks B.

### 5.2 Verify with Code

**Verify** contracts against actual code when target files exist:
```bash
grep -rn "consumedThing" ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/
```

- Contract matches code → confidence high
- Contract doesn't match → update understanding, re-evaluate relation

**Record**: `Pair | Current Relation | Should Be | Reason`

### 5.3 Check Priority Alignment

For each blocking relationship (A blocks B):
- If A.priority > B.priority (lower urgency number = higher priority) → misaligned
- If A has `critical-path` label and priority != 1 (Urgent) → misaligned

**For proposed issues**: Skip if no priority assigned yet.

**Add** to `priority_misalignment[]`:
```json
{"id": "[ISSUE_ID]", "current": 3, "should_be": 1, "reason": "Blocks critical path issue [OTHER_ISSUE_ID]"}
```

### 5.4 Verify Agent Labels

**Check** each issue's `agent:X` label against its content.

**Code verification** (when target exists):
```bash
# Check if target is in specific directory
ls ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/[TARGET_MODULE]/

# Check for public function signatures
grep -rn "pub fn\|export function\|def " ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/[TARGET_MODULE]/
```

**Add** to `agent_mismatch[]`:
```json
{"id": "[ISSUE_ID]", "current": "frontend", "should_be": "backend", "reason": "Target is backend module", "signals": ["module in src/backend", "pub fn signature"]}
```

### 5.5 Verify Label Co-occurrence

**Step 1 — Heuristic**: If issue lacks a required label, check title/description against detection signals. If 2+ signals match → add finding with `present: "[signals]"`.

**Add** to `label_cooccurrence[]`:
```json
{"id": "[ISSUE_ID]", "title": "...", "present": "[signals]", "missing": "design", "reason": "Design signals detected but design label missing"}
```

---

## 6. Cross-Project Analysis

### 6.1 Check for Duplicates

**Compare** input issues against ALL issues from comparison set (1.4):

**Same-project duplicates**:
- Same problem + same approach = duplicate → add to `duplicates[]`

**Cross-project duplicates**:
- Same problem + same approach in different project = duplicate → add to `duplicates[]` with consolidation recommendation
- Same problem + different approach = keep both, add `related`

**Module-name fallback**: When title/keyword matching finds no duplicates for a proposed issue, extract the module or component name from its location field and search existing issues for that module name in title or description. Different terminology for the same component won't match on keywords but will match on shared module name.

**Supersession detection**: When input item's scope FULLY COVERS an existing issue's scope, add to input item's `supersedes[]` (not `duplicates[]`).

Signals:
- Input item's `decision_ref` supersedes existing issue's governing decision
- Input item's `creates[]` is superset of existing issue's deliverables
- Existing issue references a superseded decision

### 6.2 Check for Obsolete

Detect issues that should be canceled because work is complete.

**Deep verification (REQUIRED)** — Do NOT add to `obsolete[]` without code verification:

1. **Extract deliverables** from issue description

2. **Verify EACH deliverable** exists in codebase:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "pub fn [FUNCTION]\|pub struct [TYPE]\|export class [TYPE]\|export function [FUNCTION]" ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/
   ```

3. **Read implementation files** — check for stubs vs complete code

4. **Calculate confidence**:

| Evidence | Confidence |
|----------|------------|
| All deliverables implemented + tests | 100% |
| All deliverables implemented, no tests | 90% |
| Most deliverables, some stubs | 50% — Do NOT add |
| Partial implementation | 0% — Keep issue |

**>=90% confidence required** to add to `obsolete[]`.

**Decision-eliminated issues**: When `DECISION_REF` is present, also detect issues made unnecessary by the decision changing approach (not scope). Use decider skill's `$DECISIONS_CMD get [DECISION_REF]` to locate the file.

1. **Read decision** document (path from decider CLI output)
2. **Extract eliminated patterns**: From Context/Decision, identify approaches explicitly replaced
3. **Search comparison set** for issues implementing eliminated patterns — match title, description, deliverables referencing old pattern
4. **Exclude** issues already in `supersedes[]` (replaced by new issues, not eliminated)
5. **Add** to `obsolete[]`: confidence 100%, evidence `{decision_eliminated: true, decision_ref: "[REF]", eliminated_pattern: "..."}`, reason `"[REF] eliminates: [OLD] → [NEW]"`

### 6.3 Check Project Fit

For each input issue, compare against ALL project definitions from 1.5:

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Issue scope matches different project better | Add to `wrong_project[]` with target project |
| Issue is child but in different project than parent | Add to `wrong_project[]` — detach from parent, move or re-parent |
| Issue depends on work tracked in different project | Add cross-project `related` to `add_relations[]` |
| Issue duplicates work in different project | Add to `duplicates[]` |

**Evaluate objectively** — do not assume current project assignment is correct.

---

## 7. Hierarchy Analysis

### 7.1 Identify Candidates

**From caller context** (hints, not directives):
- `parent_issue`: Issue being worked on — in-scope items become children
- `blocked_issues`: Hierarchy hints (research-complete only) — consider if scope is strict subset

**Parent candidates** (when no `parent_issue` context):
- 2+ input issues with same target → one could be parent
- Large issue (estimate >=4) with implicit sub-tasks → breakdown candidate
- From `blocked_issues` context: parent candidates for issues that are subsets of their scope

**Child candidates**:
- Input issue is small piece of larger tracked effort
- Explicit "step N" or phased work pattern
- Issue scope is strict subset of a `blocked_issues` entry's scope

**Bundle candidates** — 2+ input issues share:
- Same `agent:X` label + same project + same work type
- Same refactor/migration pattern applied to sibling components
- Related targets in same domain

**Note**: Do not gate bundles on estimate size. Two estimate-3 issues with identical patterns are a stronger bundle than two estimate-1 issues with unrelated targets.

**Note**: Research issues should NEVER appear in `parent_issue`. Use `blocked_issues` for research-complete flows.

**Same-project constraint**: Parent and child must be in the same project. If projects differ, add to `wrong_project[]` or keep standalone with `related`. See [dependencies.md](../references/dependencies.md).

### 7.2 Evaluate Coherence

For each candidate, ask: **Would these naturally ship together in one PR?**

| Signal | Lean sub-issue | Lean independent |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Scope alignment** | Same scope as parent | Subset or superset of parent's scope |
| **Domain match** | Same concerns as parent | Introduces orthogonal concerns |
| **Review coherence** | Reviewer expects both | Would distract from parent's review |

**Lean independent when**:
- Platform-specific work under cross-platform parent
- Tooling/methodology under feature parent
- Work could ship before or after parent

**Lean sub-issue when**:
- Platform-specific under same-platform parent
- Tests for the feature being implemented
- Hardening for the component being built

**When uncertain**: Prefer independent with blocking relation. Easier to merge later than to split.

### 7.3 Validate Scope Coverage

**Skip if** MODE = issue.

For each parent issue with children:

1. **Check description format**: parent has `## Requirements` (implementation scope) vs `## Sub-Issues` (coordination summary)

2. **If parent has implementation scope** not mapped to children → add to `analysis[]`: "Parent [ISSUE_ID] has `## Requirements` not decomposed into sub-issues."

3. **Check agent labels**: if children have 2+ distinct `agent:X` but parent lacks `agent:multi` → add to `agent_mismatch[]`

4. **Check `## Sub-Issues` list matches actual children**: Compare issue IDs listed in parent description vs actual `children[]` from API. If mismatched (missing or extra entries), add to `hierarchy[]` with action `update_parent_desc` and reason noting the stale entries.

### 7.4 Record Hierarchy Findings

**PROJECT mode**: Add to `findings.hierarchy[]`:

| Action | Fields | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `make_parent` | `issue`, `children[]` | Issue becomes parent of listed issues |
| `make_child` | `issue`, `parent` | Issue becomes sub-issue of parent |
| `bundle` | `issues[]`, `new_parent_title` | Create new parent, group issues under it |
| `update_parent_desc` | `issue` | Parent's `## Sub-Issues` is stale — sync with actual children |

**ISSUE mode**: Set `hierarchy` on each issue per [audit-output.md](../schemas/audit-output.md) Hierarchy Field.

Include `reason` explaining the coherence evaluation.

---

## 8. Combination Candidates

**Add** to `combine[]` when issues should merge:
- Small scope issues that together form logical unit
- Overlapping creates/consumes causing unnecessary fragmentation
- Near-duplicate scope where one subsumes the other

**Include** `target` (issue to keep) and `absorb[]` (issues to merge into it).

---

## 9. Architecture Gap Analysis

**Skip if** MODE = issue.

### 9.1 Fetch Architecture Documentation

Read architecture docs relevant to project scope.

Extract:
- **Module paths**: Directory structure
- **Components**: Named subsystems
- **Interfaces**: Traits, message types, subscriptions
- **Performance targets**: Latency budgets, throughput requirements

### 9.2 Analyze Implementation State

For each module from 9.1:
```bash
ls -la ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/[MODULE]/
grep -rn "pub struct\|pub fn\|pub trait\|export class\|export function" ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/[MODULE]/
grep -rn "TODO\|unimplemented\|todo\|FIXME" ${WORKTREE:-.}/src/[MODULE]/
```

Classify:

| Status | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Implemented** | Module exists, functions present, no major TODOs |
| **Stubbed** | Module exists, functions return placeholders |
| **Missing** | Module/directory doesn't exist |

### 9.3 Compare Architecture vs Backlog

For each architecture component:

1. **Search ALL project backlogs** (from 1.4) for matching issues

2. **Check implementation state** from 9.2

3. **Mark as GAP** if: architecture requires it + no issue exists + not implemented

**Project placement for gaps**:
- Gap matches completed project scope → evaluate reopening (9.5)
- Gap matches different active project → assign to that project
- Gap doesn't fit any project → evaluate new project (9.5)

### 9.4 Classify and Record Gaps

**Add** to `architecture_gaps[]` with category:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Blocks 2+ existing issues | Implementation issue, P1 |
| **Required** | Architecture-specified, no blockers | Implementation issue, P2 |
| **Research** | Optional/future, needs investigation | Research issue |

**Include** `reasoning` (2-4 sentences), `evidence`, `blocked_issues[]`, `project_placement`, `recommended_issue`.

### 9.5 Evaluate Project-Level Changes

**New project** — Add to `project_recommendations[]` when:
- 3+ related gaps form subsystem
- Scope >8 pts
- No existing project fit

**Reopen project** — Add when:
- Gap matches completed project scope
- AND: blocks active work OR deliverables incomplete

---

## 10. Determine Actions

**Skip if** MODE = project.

### 10.1 Validate Actionability

For each proposed issue, check actionability — ensure it has clear scope, testable criteria, and defined deliverables.

**Actionability determination:**
- All criteria pass → 10.2
- Any criterion fails → `skip` with reason: `"Too vague — [missing criterion]"`

### 10.2 Assign Actions

For each input issue, assign action based on analysis:

| Action | Meaning | `target` field |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `valid` | Correctly configured, relation corrections only | null |
| `create` | Create new issue | null |
| `skip` | Don't create — duplicate, vague, or observation | reason string |
| `expand` | Expand existing issue to include this work | issue to expand |
| `update` | Update existing issue description | issue to update |
| `supersede` | Cancel existing, create new (scope changed) | issue to cancel |
| `combine` | Absorb into existing issue | issue to absorb into |
| `cancel` | Cancel — obsolete | null |

**Action determination logic**:
1. If actionability check failed (10.1) → `skip` (reason = vague description)
2. If `obsolete[]` contains issue → `cancel`
3. If `duplicates[]` contains issue as `remove` → `skip` (target = `keep` issue)
4. If `combine[]` contains issue in `absorb[]` AND target issue state is not Done/Cancelled → `combine` (target = `target` issue)
5. If proposed issue overlaps existing AND existing issue state is not Done/Cancelled → `expand` or `update` based on scope delta
6. Otherwise → `create` (proposed) or `valid` (existing)

**Completed issue guard**: Steps 4-5 exclude Done/Cancelled issues as targets. Completed work is a historical record — new scope belongs in new issues. If overlap is detected with a completed issue, fall through to step 6 (`create`) and add a `related` relation to the completed issue for traceability.

**Supersedes population**:

1. **Verify**: For each `create` action, check `supersedes[]` populated from 6.1 findings
2. **Validate entries**: Each must have `identifier`, `title`, `reason`
3. **Update summary**: Set `summary.superseded` to total count across all issues

**Research traceability**: If `SOURCE == "research-complete"` and `RESEARCH_ISSUE` is set, add `RESEARCH_ISSUE` to `add_relations.related[]` for all `create` actions. This ensures created issues link back to the research that spawned them.
