//! The commit, push and pull-request offer that follows a kendex write in a
//! git project.
//!
//! kendex writes files into a checkout, and a project commits those files
//! so that a clone works without kendex. This module is what asks what to
//! do with them, and it is the whole of that answer for both surfaces: the
//! CLI and the app call the same scan, take the same choices and read the
//! same failures, so neither can offer something the other would refuse.
//!
//! **The offer is explicit.** kendex commits, pushes or opens a pull
//! request only after a person chose that in this run. There is no setting,
//! flag or state that makes any of the three happen without a choice, and
//! leaving the files as diffs is a choice of the same standing as the other
//! three.
//!
//! **kendex stages only the files it owns whole.** A file the person wrote
//! is never staged and never committed, and a shared configuration file
//! kendex writes one key in is not a file it owns whole: git has no way to
//! commit one key, so committing such a path would commit the person's
//! edits with kendex's. [`crate::engine::GeneratedPaths`] is where that
//! split is made, once, for the inventory and for this.
//!
//! **kendex never undoes.** It does not revert a commit, does not move a
//! branch ref backwards, does not reset, and does not stash. The two
//! cleanups here — unstaging what its own `git add` staged, and removing an
//! empty branch it made a moment earlier — are kendex clearing its own
//! leftovers: no commit exists to undo, and no branch ref moves backwards.
