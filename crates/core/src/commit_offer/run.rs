//! What each choice runs, and what it leaves behind when a step refuses.
//!
//! `git commit --only -- <paths>` is a partial commit, and five of its
//! behaviours decide the shape here. It refuses a path git does not track,
//! so the untracked members are staged first. It commits the working
//! tree's content for the named paths, not the index's, so a person who
//! staged an older copy of a render gets the copy kendex wrote. It commits
//! a deletion of a named path that is gone, which is how a sweep's
//! removals land. It builds a temporary index and exports it to the hooks,
//! so a hook running `git diff --cached` sees the named paths and nothing
//! else and a refused commit leaves the person's own staged changes
//! exactly as they were. And it commits the whole of each file it names,
//! which is why the shared `edits` targets are out of the set.
