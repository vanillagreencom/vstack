//! The one sealed API for reading catalog content. Foreign catalogs are
//! adversarial input: every read resolves against the canonical source
//! root, refuses to look through symlinks (a hostile catalog must not pull
//! host files into rendered artifacts or recurse forever), and carries
//! depth, count, and byte budgets. This is the door for a catalog's bytes,
//! and the guard bans raw `fs` reads over catalog paths to keep it so.
//!
//! One probe is asked outside it: `source::slot_free` reads a local-source
//! path through `fs::entry`, which is the raw half, because a write-guard
//! has to see a dangling link as an occupant where the containment check
//! here refuses outright. That is a path no source contains yet, not a
//! catalog's content.
