//! Authoring validation over a catalog directory: what a maintainer can
//! know about their own content before anyone installs it.
//!
//! Three passes over every item. The structural pass asks whether each
//! harness's loader could hold this item at all — a name it will not
//! accept, a SKILL.md that disagrees with its own directory. The settings
//! pass reads a settings template against the grammar the shell loaders
//! read a consumer's settings file with. The safety pass runs the same
//! rules an install runs, so a catalog finds out in its own CI rather than
//! in somebody else's plan preview.
//!
//! Every pass only reports what an author can act on. Anything rendering
//! resolves on its own is not a problem this can help with, and naming it
//! would send people to fix something that is not broken.
//!
//! This lives in core because the CLI's `check --catalog`, the indexer's
//! per-package scores, and authoring preflight all ask the same questions
//! of the same bytes — one implementation, one answer.
