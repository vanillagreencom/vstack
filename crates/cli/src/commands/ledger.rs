//! How a run ends. A count of writes alone answers "did anything happen"
//! and nothing else: the installs the plan refused and the scores worth
//! reading are both outcomes of the same run, and a reader who has to run
//! a second command to learn they exist was not told.
//!
//! One line, one part per outcome, and under it the next step for each
//! outcome it carries. A completed write is not one of those: it needs no
//! next step, and the count says all there is to say about it.
//!
//! Every verb that writes closes on this. What differs between them is
//! the verb in the head — refreshed, applied, installed, removed — and
//! nothing else: the parts are outcomes of a plan, and every verb that
//! runs a plan can have them.
