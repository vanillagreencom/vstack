//! Where it runs: [`after_writing`] is called from [`super::engine_common::apply_report`],
//! the one door every verb executes a plan through, and from `update-pi`,
//! which writes into a project's `.pi` directory without going through it.
//! A verb cannot be added without the offer, and no verb can offer twice
//! for one project: the session below records which roots have been asked.
//!
//! What it says: every line the offer prints lives in [`block`], the way
//! the app keeps its own wording in one copy module. The two are reviewed
//! beside each other, and they say the same things in the same order.
