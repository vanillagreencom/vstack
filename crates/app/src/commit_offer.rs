//! The desktop's half of the commit, push and pull-request offer: the read
//! that says what one project has to offer, and one command per step the
//! window can run.
//!
//! A step each rather than a command per route, because the window draws
//! the step that is running and has its own designed state for each way one
//! can refuse. Every command here is a thin pass to
//! [`kendex_core::commit_offer`], which both shells share, so the window
//! cannot offer something the terminal would refuse.
//!
//! Nothing here words anything. A refusal travels as the program's own
//! lines and the step that produced them, and `ui/src/lib/copy-commit-offer.ts`
//! is where every sentence the window shows lives.
