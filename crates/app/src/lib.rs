/// write and forgets it dropped the rejection: the busy flag fell, nothing
/// was said, and the click read as having done nothing. Folded here, a
/// transport failure lands in the shape every caller already reads a
/// refusal in.
///
/// A command returning a plain value gets no wrapper, tauri-specta emitting
/// one only where there is a refusal type to name, so its rejection reaches
/// its caller unfolded and a fire-and-forget read drops it. Returning a
/// `Result` is what puts a command behind the wrapper, which is the whole
/// reason `app_version`, `capability_table`, `mine_authoring_doc` and
/// `window_zoom_state` answer one they never refuse with. `deep_link_take`
/// is the one command left outside, deliberately: its only caller reads it
/// through `caught` in `ui/src/lib/deep-link.ts`. That set is pinned by
/// `crates/app/tests/bindings.rs`, so a fifth is an edit to the list rather
/// than a command that regenerates clean and reds nothing.
///
/// `E | string` in the signature is what holds a reader honest: the fold
/// puts a bare message in the `E` slot, and declaring that widening is what
/// makes `tsc` name every reader branching on a discriminant the runtime
/// does not guarantee. Read the refusal through `ui/src/lib/refusal.ts`
/// rather than off its fields — `refusalKind` still branches on the kind,
/// it just answers `null` where a shape never arrived. The words a
/// rejection with nothing to say falls back to are `NO_REASON_GIVEN` in
/// `ui/src/lib/settled.ts`, which folds the same failure for work that is
/// not a command; `ui/src/bindings.test.ts` holds this copy to those words.
